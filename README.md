# Pensions simulator/calculator for Nicaragua's national pension system
Pension simulator for Nicaragua's Defined Benefit pensions system (INSS), designed with Tkinter. 

I used Python to build a defined benefit (DB) pension simulator for Nicaraguaâ€™s social security system. It works as a software for Windows that allows users to simulate their future pension benefits under different scenarios. 

For a detailed description of how it works take a look at my blog:

I have the formulas for 34 systems (DCs, CDs and mix) in Latin America and the Caribbean and I would share the code with partners willing to build such simulators for other LAC countries. This projects belongs to a bigger project for pension simulators for Latin America. See:

The Pensioncalc.py file has the python script. I used Inno Setup (http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) to create a Windows Istaller for the calculator.
