# Pensions simulator/calculator for Nicaragua's national pension system
Pension simulator for Nicaragua's Defined Benefit pensions system (INSS), designed with Tkinter. 

I used Python to build a defined benefit (DB) pension simulator for Nicaraguaâ€™s social security system. It works as a software for Windows that allows users to simulate their future pension benefits under different scenarios (wage path, density of contributions, etc.). 

For a detailed description of how it works take a look at my blog:

I have the formulae for 34 systems (Defined Benefit, Defined Contribution and Mix/Hybrid) in Latin America and the Caribbean. I am sharing the code to see if I find people willing to build such simulators for other LAC countries. This projects was built upon a bigger project for pension simulators for Latin America. See:

The Pensioncalc.py file has the python script. I used Inno Setup (http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) to create a Windows Installer for the calculator. You can download the Windows Installer here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y37eT5M3ClFG9_aJxhGrYyNPJc6jrfO1/view?usp=sharing
